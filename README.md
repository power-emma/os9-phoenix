# os9-phoenix
### My personal website, inspired by the classic MacOS theme, built using React
As per the "phoenix", this is a revival of a similarly themed project I made in regular JavaScript

React was chosen due to it's component system, allowing any react application to be nested in a window object. It's robust state manager also allowed for easier implementation of features such as and "active window" system and window closing

## Included Applications
